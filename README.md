# Usage Examples
Hereâ€™s how to use the Customer, Restaurant, and Review models with the data.

Customer Model
```py
from models.customer import Customer

# Find customer by ID
alice = Customer.find_by_id(1)
print(alice)  # Output: <Customer 1: Alice>

# Update customer information
alice.body = "Loves pizza and outdoor seating."
alice.update()

# Retrieve all customers
customers = Customer.get_all()
print(customers)  # Output: [<Customer 1: Alice>, <Customer 2: Keith>, <Customer 3: Lio>]
```

Restaurant Model
```py
from models.restaurant import Restaurant

# Find restaurant by name
pizza_inn = Restaurant.find_by_name("Pizza Inn")
print(pizza_inn)  # Output: <Restaurant 1: Pizza Inn>

# Update restaurant rating
pizza_inn.rating = "4.6"
pizza_inn.update()

# Retrieve all restaurants
restaurants = Restaurant.get_all()
print(restaurants)  # Output: [<Restaurant 1: Pizza Inn>, <Restaurant 2: Mountain Delight>, <Restaurant 3: Urban Eats>]

```

Review Model
```py
from models.review import Review

# Retrieve all reviews
reviews = Review.get_all()
print(reviews)
# Output: [<Review 1: Amazing pizza and great ambiance!>, <Review 2: Breathtaking views and delicious food!>, <Review 3: Great vibe, but food was average.>]

# Update a review comment
review = Review.find_by_id(1)
review.comment = "Best pizza place I've visited!"
review.update()

# Delete a review
review.delete()
```

### Running the CLI
To interact with your database through the CLI, follow these steps:

Start the CLI
Run the CLI script (replace cli.py with your main file if necessary).
```txt
python cli.py
```

# Conclusion
This project provides a foundational structure for managing customers, restaurants, and reviews through a simple database model. Using this setup, you can easily create, update, retrieve, and delete records for each entity. The example usage and sample data demonstrate how to interact with the database and provide a good starting point for further development or customization.
